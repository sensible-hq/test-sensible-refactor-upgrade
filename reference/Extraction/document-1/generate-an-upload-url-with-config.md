excerpt: >-
  This endpoint's behavior is identical to the [Extract doc at a Sensible
  URL](ref:generate-upload-url) endpoint's behavior, except that Sensible uses
  the specified config to extract data from the document instead of
  automatically choosing the best-scoring extraction in the document type.
